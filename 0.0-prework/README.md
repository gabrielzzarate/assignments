# Prework

## Hello and welcome to Front End Engineering!

I hope you're excited about this new possibility, this turning point in your career. I am. I'm really looking forward to meeting each of you in person and getting to know you better over the course of the upcoming 12 weeks. I'm also really excited about teaching and mentoring you all and seeing what awesome things you'll build and what interesting ways you'll approach the assignments and projects in the class.

If you have any questions, please [email me](mailto:jake@theironyard.com), and I'll attempt to answer you promptly.

## Objectives
The following are the learning objectives for this prework, all of which are
important requirements expected of a professional developer. Though they are
not technically programming skills, they are crucially important to success
both during the class and on the job.

1. Be able to communicate technical accomplishments and struggles in writing.
2. Be able to learn in contexts that aren't necessarily suited to your primary learning style.
3. Adapt to the workflows used by professional developers (using the command line in particular)
4. Be able to develop a very basic, static web site using HTML and CSS.
5. Describe the importance of mindset on learning and be able to analyze one's own type of mindset.

## Step One: Getting Starting

### Bookmark important sites

- [ ] Bookmark the assignments repository: https://github.com/tiy-greenville-frontend-2016-feb/assignments
- [ ] Bookmark the notes sites: http://jacobthemyth.gitbooks.io/tiy-greenville-frontend-2016-feb/content/

### Read the course overview

Make sure you understand the policies and course details

- [ ] Read through the syllabus: http://jacobthemyth.gitbooks.io/tiy-greenville-frontend-2016-feb/content/

### GitHub

  - [ ] Create a Github account: https://github.com/signup
  - [ ] Add a picture and your full name: https://github.com/settings/profile

### Treehouse

- [ ] Sign up for an account at [Treehouse (referral link)](http://referrals.trhou.se/jacobthemyth).

Signing up does require a credit card, but you will have a free trial for the first 14 days. If you do not have any access to a credit card, that is ok! Let me know via email and I can help you make that happen.


### Mindset

- [ ] Read [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)

### Survey

- [ ] Fill out this survey: http://goo.gl/forms/TM2iXfRtSe

## Step Two: Workstation

- [ ] Upgrade your operating system to El Capitain: http://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/
- [ ] Install Atom: https://atom.io
- [ ] Install Google Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/
- [ ] Install iTerm: http://iterm2.com/downloads.html (you will want the 10.7+ version)

## Step Three: Till the Soil

### Front End Development

We will be covering the fundamentals of front end development in detail in our class, but having a shared vocabulary from the beginning is essential to us quickly jumping in.

- [ ] Join the Front End Development track on Treehouse: https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development
- [ ] Complete the How to Make a Website course
- [ ] Complete the CSS Basics course
- [ ] Complete the JavaScript Basics course
- [ ] Complete the Console Foundations course
- [ ] Complete the Git Basics course

Further courses are optional, but will likely be very helpful.

## Bonus (Optional)

### Typing

Believe it or not, *a lot* of time in the first weeks of programming is spent fixing simple typing errors. It would not be ridiculous to suggest that many of you will spend 12-24 hours (or more) fixing typing errors during class.

If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try http://www.keybr.com/). If you already know how to touch type, I would highly recommend working through the JavaScript lessons on http://typing.io. Typing for programming is actually a good bit different than everyday typing, so getting some practice in could potentially save you a ton of time the first few weeks of class.

### Design

Our class will be focused more on engineering than on design. So, it will be helpful if you already have a pretty good handle on design principles. Here are some helpful resources.

- [Hack Design](https://hackdesign.org/)
- [Treehouse: Web Design](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/web-design)

### The Command Line

- [ ] Read and practice with [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)

### git

- [ ] Complete [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)
